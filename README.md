Problem #2
Implement the business functionality for the simple search page so that the
following workflow would success:
1. User type in search keyword in “Name” textbox (required field)
2. User select either “Male” or “Female” or Both or Nothing (having both or nothing
selected result in both genders being returned)
3. User hits search
4. System retrieves a maximum of 10 records of people:
+ Whose name contains the keyword that the user search for.
+ And gender matches what the user selected
(Male -> Only male records are looked up
Female -> Only female records are looked up
Both or nothing -> Both male and female records are looked up)
5. System display the result in a grid (or in any other representation you prefer / think
would better suit the scenario), on the same page.
